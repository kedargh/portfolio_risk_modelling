## Run the below lines to setup the libraries and the necessary environment - 

$ pip install pandas numpy yfinance matplotlib 

The repo is divided into 2 main folders - 
$ /src
$ /data

To just test the project on how it's working on randomly generated files run - (THIS IS ALREADY DONE DON'T DO IT)
$ /src python3 file_generator.py
The files for a few sample stocks will be generated for testing and running the risk_modelling.py 

Once the files are created you can run the following lines- 
$ /src python3 risk_modelling.py

Run the python file in venv if visualisation is not properly done.
Sometimes the visualisation is visible for some time and then it vanishes due to a GUI error (Try to figure that out)

Your task Tejas is - 
0) Mention the collaborators as - 
    Code - Kedar Kenjalkar
    Documentation - Tejas Udgiri and Kedar Kenjalkar
1) Research more about how risk is modelled for a portfolio of equity stocks.
2) Make sense out of the program.
3) Take visualisation pictures
4) Delete the commented lines (They were for debugging purposes only)
5) Write down the documentation in md(Markdown) in the below format-
    .what is risk modelling?
    .the mathematics involved in this case linear algebra for matrix calculations 
    .setup instructions 
    .how to run the code 
    .and visualisation output
    .add the graphs in the documentation wherever possible *****IMP
